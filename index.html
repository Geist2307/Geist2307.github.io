        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>I'm Andrei, a <b> Data Scientist</b> from a Physics background. 
        </p>

        <p> My journey into science began early on, as I distinguished  myself in Romania's <b>National Physics Olympiads</b> during my high school years. 
            The Olympiads were competitions which tested student's theorethical and experimental problem-solving skills in Physics.
            These competitons had three stages: local, county, and national.
            Each year, about 2000 students competed at the county level. From these about 100 would progress to the national stage.
            From there, a separate selection process would determine the students who represented Romania in international competitions.
            The selection process has two stages. First, a rigorous 5-hour exam identified the top 20 most qualified students for all years. Then, a two-week stage of exams would narrow down the selection to 5 students. These 5 students would then go on to represent Romania in the  <a href="https://www.bpho.org.uk/IPhO/" target="_blank">IPhO</a>.
            From grade 9 to grade 12, my results placed me consistently in the top 10 students of my year in the National Physics Olympiads. In 2012, and then again in 2013, I qualified in the top 20 students of all years that could represent Romania internationally. As an estimate, I was in the top 0.25% of high school students in Romania in Physics. 
  
        </p>

        <p>  After high school, I took a gap year to travel an volunteer before earning my MPhys degree from the University of Southampton in 2019. 
            For my final-year project I collborated with the <a href="https://www.orc.soton.ac.uk/who-we-are" target="_blank">Optoelectronics Research Centre(ORC)</a>. 
            I conducted experiments and analyzed time-series data
            to investigate whether using Hollow-Core fibres could enhance phase stability in Quantum Repeater Architectures. I obtained first-class honours for my project work (71%). The  project honed my skills
            in experimental design, data analysis and model building </p> 

         <p> Following my MPhys, I pursued an intellectual passion I had for years, Semiotics. I graduated with an MA Semiotics degree from 
             the University of Tartu in 2022, achieving an overall grade B. While not directly related to my Physics background, the program
            helped me develop skills in critical thinking, argumentation, and writing.
             During my studies, I worked  with the department of Philosophy at the University of Tartu 
             to analyze student enrollment data, providing insights that helped refine the design of the 
             MA programme in Philosophy to attract more fee-paying students. </p>

        <p> In August 2022, I joined the University of Tartu's Physics department as a <strong>Junior Research Fellow in Physics (Computational Imaging) </strong>.
            My responsabilities included optical experiments - improving the I-COACH and FINCH holographic techniques - and algorithm development
            , namely the Lucy-Richardson-Rosen Algorithm, a deconvolution algorithm for image reconstruction. I contributed to several projects, and I am first author for work published in <a href="https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-31-16-26120&id=535384" target="_blank">Optics Express</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211379723006320?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">Results in Physics</a>. 
            I also secured a French bursary to visit the University of Bordeaux to introduce the FINCH technique to Prof. Etienne Brasselet's SINGULAR group.  I presented my work publicly at the 2023 SPIE Photonics Europe conference in Prague.
            In addition, I co-organized the "CIPHering with CIPHR" Hackathon in September 2022, which was a 48-hour hackaton meant to introduce students to the field of Computational Imaging. As part of this Hackathon,
            I gave a lecture on the basics of Computational Imaging, and I mentored students in developing their projects. As side projects,  I worked on projects involving GAN's and AutoEncoders for image denoising. 
        </p>

        <p> By July 2023, recognizing the strong overlap between Computational Imaging and AI, I fully transtioned into data science. I initially worked as an independent Data Science contractor, before enrolling in my
              <strong>MSc in Data Science at the University of St Andrews </strong>. The program emphasizes hands-on, industry-relevant experience, with assignments requiring end-to-end workflows using tools like PyTorch, PySpark, and Scikit-Learn.
             As I am set to graduate in August 2025, I am eager to leverage my expertise in AI and Data Science to build impactful solutions.
