        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>I'm Andrei, a <b> Data Scientist</b>. In my previous life, I was a Physicist. My background in Physics established 
            a strong mathematical foundation that I found invaluable in my transition to Data Science. 
            I am passionate about using data to build models that solve real-world problems.
        </p>

        <p> My journey into science began early on, as I distinguished  myself in Romania's <b>National Physics Olympiads</b> during my high school years. 
            The Olympiads were competitions which tested student's theorethical and experimental problem-solving skills in Physics beyond the required school curriculum.
            About 2000 students from each year of study  competed at the county level. From these about 100 would progress to the national stage.
            From there, a separate process would select students to represent Romania in international competitions. The selection for internationa competitions comprised of two stages.
            In the first stage, a rigorous 5-hour exam identified the top 20 most qualified students from all study years.
            Then, these top 20 students would undergo an additional training period followed by exams which would select the top 5. These 5 students would then go on to represent Romania in the  <a href="https://www.bpho.org.uk/IPhO/" target="_blank">International Physics Olympiad (IPhO)</a>.
            From grade 9 to grade 12, my results placed me consistently in the top 10 students of my year of study in the National Physics Olympiads. In 2012, and then again in 2013, I qualified in the top 20 students of all years that could represent Romania internationally. 
            This means I was very fortunate to compete with the top 0.25% of students of my generation in Physics. 
        </p>

        <p>  After high school, I took a gap year to travel an volunteer before earning my integrated Masters (MPhys) degree in Physics, from the University of Southampton in 2019, achieving an overal result of Second Class Honours - Upper Division (2:1). 
            For my final-year project I collborated with the <a href="https://www.orc.soton.ac.uk/who-we-are" target="_blank">Optoelectronics Research Centre(ORC)</a>. 
            I conducted experiments and analyzed time-series data
            to investigate whether using Hollow-Core fibres could enhance phase stability in Quantum Repeater Architectures. I obtained first-class honours for this project (71%). The  project honed my skills
            in experimental design, data analysis and building mathematical models.  </p> 

         <p> Following my MPhys, I decided to take a break from Physics, to pursue an intellectual interest I developed over several years: Semiotics. 
            I graduated with an MA Semiotics degree from 
             the University of Tartu in 2022, achieving an overall grade B. While not directly related to my Physics background, the programme
             helped me develop skills in critical thinking, argumentation, and writing.
             During my studies, I kept my data analysis skills sharp by working with the department of Philosophy at the University of Tartu on a project
             that aimed to redesign the current MA programme in Philosophy. I used Python
             to analyze student enrollment data, providing insights that helped refine the design of the 
             MA programme in Philosophy to attract more fee-paying students. </p>

        <p> In August 2022, I joined the University of Tartu's Physics department as a <strong>Junior Research Fellow in Physics (Computational Imaging) </strong>.
            My responsabilities included optical experiments - improving the I-COACH and FINCH holographic techniques - and algorithm development
            ,namely the Lucy-Richardson-Rosen Algorithm, a deconvolution algorithm for image reconstruction. I contributed to several projects, and I was first author on papers published <a href="https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-31-16-26120&id=535384" target="_blank">Optics Express</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211379723006320?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">Results in Physics</a>. 
            In addition to research, I was also involved in teaching and communicating science. Some activities included securing a French Government bursary to visit the University of Bordeaux to introduce the FINCH technique to Prof. Etienne Brasselet's SINGULAR group,and presenting some of my work publicly at the 2023 SPIE Photonics Europe conference in Prague.
            In addition, I co-organized the "CIPHering with CIPHR" Hackathon in September 2022. This was a 48-hour Hackathon meant to introduce students to the field of Computational Imaging. As part of this Hackathon,
            I gave a workshop on the basics of image processing in MATLAB, and I designed some practical problems through which students could learn about our work. During my time at Tartu, I also explored directions in AI. In my spare time, I implemented GANs and AutoEncoders for image denoising. 
        </p>

        <p> By July 2023, recognizing the strong overlap between Computational Imaging and AI, I fully transtioned into data science. I started out as an independent Data Science contractor, before enrolling in my
              <strong>MSc in Data Science at the University of St Andrews </strong>. The program emphasizes hands-on, industry-relevant experience, with assignments requiring end-to-end workflows for machine learning and deep learning using tools like PyTorch, PySpark, and Scikit-Learn.
              Graduating in August 2025, I am eager to leverage my expertise in AI and Data Science to build impactful solutions for business problems.
